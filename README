MooX::Lsub

I often want to use a lot of lazy build subs to implement some plumbing,
with scope to allow it to be overridden by people who know what they're
doing with an injection library like Bread::Board.

Usually, the syntax of "Class::Tiny" is what I use for such things.

  use Class::Tiny {
    'a' => sub { },
    'b' => sub { },
  };

Etc.

But switching things to Moo means I usually have to get much uglier, and
repeat myself a *lot*.

So this module exists as a compromise.

Additionally, I always forgot to declare "use Moo 1.000008" which was
the first version of "Moo" where "builder => sub" worked, and I would
invariably get silly test failures in smokers as a consequence.

This module avoids such problem entirely, and is tested to work with
"Moo 0.009001".
