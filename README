NAME
    MooX::Lsub - Very shorthand syntax for bulk lazy builders

VERSION
    version 0.002000

SYNOPSIS
      use MooX::Lsub;

      # Shorthand for
      # has foo => ( is => ro =>, lazy => 1, builder => '_build_foo' );
      # sub _build_foo { "Hello" }

      lsub foo => sub { "Hello" };

DESCRIPTION
    I often want to use a lot of lazy build subs to implement some plumbing,
    with scope to allow it to be overridden by people who know what they're
    doing with an injection library like Bread::Board.

    Usually, the syntax of "Class::Tiny" is what I use for such things.

      use Class::Tiny {
        'a' => sub { },
        'b' => sub { },
      };

    Etc.

    But switching things to Moo means I usually have to get much uglier, and
    repeat myself a *lot*.

    So this module exists as a compromise.

    Additionally, I always forgot to declare "use Moo 1.000008" which was
    the first version of "Moo" where "builder => sub" worked, and I would
    invariably get silly test failures in smokers as a consequence.

    This module avoids such problem entirely, and is tested to work with
    "Moo 0.009001".
