=head1 NAME

MooX::Lsub - Very shorthand syntax for bulk lazy builders

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MooX::Lsub;

  # Shorthand for
  # has foo => ( is => ro =>, lazy => 1, builder => '_build_foo' );
  # sub _build_foo { "Hello" }

  lsub foo => sub { "Hello" };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I often want to use a lot of lazy build subs to implement some plumbing, with scope to allow
it to be overridden by people who know what they're doing with an injection library like Bread::Board.

Usually, the syntax of C<Class::Tiny> is what I use for such things.

  use Class::Tiny {
    'a' => sub { },
    'b' => sub { },
  };

Etc.

But switching things to Moo means I usually have to get much uglier, and repeat myself a *lot*.

So this module exists as a compromise.

Additionally, I always forgot to declare C<use Moo 1.000008> which was the first version of C<Moo> where
C<< builder => sub >> worked, and I would invariably get silly test failures in smokers as a consequence.

This module avoids such problem entirely, and is tested to work with C<Moo 0.009001>.
